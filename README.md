# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis and data cleaning using SQL skills. The project involved two main stages: data cleaning and analysis using SQL queries using PgAdmin.
The ultimate goal was to gain the highest selling , revenue of product and other relevant aspects of the E-commerce dataset.
## Process
### Step 1:: Tool Installation & Set Up
 Install PGAdmin for creating databases and running SQL queries.
 Install Visual Studio code to edit the files which download from GitHub.

### Step 2::Data Transformation
 First step is to transfer data from an external source into a PostgreSQL database using PgAdmin. 
 This likely involves tasks such as data ingestion, data mapping, and data transformation to ensure that the data 
   is in a suitable format for database storage.

### Step 3::Data Organization
 In this steps,involves data modeling and database design to ensure that the data is structured efficiently and effectively in the database. Proper organization can significantly improve query performance and data accuracy.


### Step 4::Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is an essential step to ensure data quality. It involves identifying and addressing data errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. This step is crucial to ensure the accuracy of your analysis results.

### Step 5:: Data Analysis
Once the data is in the database and cleaned, you can perform various types of data analysis. This might include running SQL queries, creating reports, generating insights, and making data-driven decisions based on the analyzed data.

### Step 4:: Add Primary key and Foregine key
 Add Primary key is a more essential part of Data Analysis which makes data unique also Foreqie key helps to create relations with tables in the dataset
### Step 5:: QA Process
 QA is a crucial step to ensure data quality, consistency, and accuracy. Such as,Remove Duplicate and NULL Values, Check Data Types Validation,Unique Values and Table Relationships (JOINs)
    
## Results
I got accurate and complete data from too messy data and run SQL queries to get outputs. 
and the questions result attached into files.

## Challenges 
(1) Problem with importing csv files into PGadmin because of path issues.
(2) Data was too messy and duplicated so it was hard to understand data.
(3) Problem with to created the primary key for a table because the table has many duplicate data.
(4) When I deleted duplicate data from tables I lost all data of tables so I created tables many times.
(5) Problem with connecting foreign key with tables because of some connection issue in PGadmin.


## Future Goals
 I will make data more concise and accurate and to get more accurate result and try to use new function of SQL which will help improve the skills of SQL.
